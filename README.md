# Predicting-Start-up-Success-with-Advanced-Predictive-Analytics
This repository contains the code and data for a project focused on predicting startup success using advanced predictive analytics. The startup ecosystem is highly dynamic and challenging, making it crucial for investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to accurately assess the potential of startups.

# Overview
The startup ecosystem is dynamic and challenging, where success hinges on various factors. Predictive analytics, particularly classification models, are essential tools for investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to assess startup potential. By leveraging historical data, these models classify startups into categories like ‘successful’ or ‘failed’ and provide insights into key success factors such as funding, market trends, and team dynamics.

# Objectives
- Evaluate Model Performance: Assess the performance of various classification models in predicting the success of startup companies based on historical data.
- Identify Key Success Factors: Determine which factors significantly influence the likelihood of a startup's success or failure.
- Provide Actionable Insights: Offer stakeholders in the startup ecosystem data-driven insights to inform decisions on investments and strategies.

# Classification Techniques
This project applies various classification techniques to a rich dataset of startups. The algorithms used include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of these models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

# Data Exploration
We start by importing the necessary libraries and reading the dataset to understand its structure and the variables it contains.
